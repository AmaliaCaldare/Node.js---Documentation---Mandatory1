        <h1>Packages and modules</h1>
        <p>When developing with Node.js, there are two terms that are frequently used and it is improtant to grasp their meaning from the beginning.</p>
        <p><span>Modules</span> represnt functionalities/ libraries organized in JavaScript files which can be reused throughout a Node.js application.</p>
        <p><span>Packages</span> are used to group together files which offer relevant tools. A package contains modules.</p>
        <p>Once you install a package, it will be installed as a dependency together with its modules.</p>
    
        <h2>NPM</h2>
        <p>NPM or Node Package Manager is the default package manager for Node.js.</p>
        <p> Node.js instalation comes with the <span>npm</span> command, which allows developers to download and install packages.</p>
        <p>When a package is installed in a project, it is considered as being a dependency.</p>
        <p>In order to keep track of the dependencies of the project, they have to be listed in a package.json file.</p>
        <p>Package.json contains informations about the project and its dependencies and it is essential for both NPM and other end users of the application. It uses the <span>"key": "value"</span> pair format, the key representing a property with its defined value.</p>
        <p>Common properties of a package.json file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"name": the name of the package.</li>
            <li>"version": </li>
            <li>"main": </li>
            <li>"repository": </li>
            <li>"scripts": allows to specify commands that are run at various times in the package
                <p>The "scripts" property is commonly used to define differences between the production and the development side. To run a script type the following command:</p>
                <pre class= "commands">
                    <code>
                        npm run [script-name]
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </li>
            <li>"dependencies": defines the other modules used by the package, by taking their name and the version of each dependency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creating a new package.json file</h3>
        <p>Type the following command:</p>
        <pre class= "commands">
            <code>
                npm init
            </code>
        </pre>
       <p>Answer the questionnaire provived in the command line.</p>

       <h3>Installing a package</h3>
       <p>If your project already contains the package.json file, by typing:</p>
       <pre class= "commands">
        <code>
            npm install
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>it will store all packages, as dependencies and along with their modules, in the <span>node_modules</span> folder.</p>
     
      <p>If you want to install a specific package, type:</p>
      <pre class= "commands">
        <code>
            npm install [package-name]
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>To list the installed packages, you can type:</p>
      <pre class= "commands">
        <code>
            npm ls
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>If you want to run a package without installing it, type:</p>
      <pre class= "commands">
        <code>
            npm install npx
            npx [command]
        </code>
      </pre>
